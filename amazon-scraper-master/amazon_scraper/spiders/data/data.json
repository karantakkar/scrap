This one has a topple-safe stand and signal detection time is better, but the display is not great for reading. Adjusting the sharpness, color balance, gamma, disabling AMA, nothing helps to make the display as crisp & sharp as the GW2255 (both were connected through DVI at 1080p). To make matters worse, the right side of the monitor is bleeding light (look at the attached photo carefully) and it is far brighter than the center of the monitor. The bleeding stays the same even if I move 3 meters away, so it is not a VA panel characteristic.

Then I thought my gpu is at fault but I connected my pc to brother's monitor and no ghosting. It becomes worse when you actually play a game. Graphic intensive games like metro exodus shows ghosting affect in entire atmosphere. Textures/edges becomes blurry and black when you move the camera in game, watch the above vid(note: it's not a glitch in game it's actual real ghosting which becomes much visible in darker background, see UFO test pic). Even CRT monitor don't get the amount of ghosting that it has.", "2) It's lower Freesync range is only 48hz: For example if you set monitor refresh rate to 60hz then freesync range is 48hz-60hz, if you set monitor refresh rate to 75hz then its range is 48hz-75hz. This is a big problem if a game has fps drops below 48fps then freesync will stop and you get massive stuttering. Also I have find a freesync bug that when your fps drops below the lower range(here 48hz) your screen will give you brightness flicker. And wow.. they haven't specified to us such important factor in details.", "3) it's response time is very bad: the 1 ms stupid vrb feature (a complete lie) that kills your eyes is not even upto its marks. As I told in point 1 that I get extreme amount of ghosting even when vrb enabled. It means it has very bad real response time(monitor ghosting is literally a high response time problem) I don't even know what could its real response time is maybe around 15-17ms.", "4) 1ms vrb is broken and is not 1 ms at all: vrb is an unfair tactic of Acer to mask its low monitor response time. It is  a LCD + VA panel monitor so it will never achive response time as low as 1-5 ms(by theory) that gaming monitors should have. 1 ms vrb is nothing but a fast rendering transparent grey image inserted at back of display at speed equal to monitor refresh rate. It gives the effect of fast visual response by eliminating (or should I say masking?) the motion blur produced by moving images. You can verify it by looking your screen with your phone camera when vrb is enabled. Sadly vrb being just an ugly masking effect does not decrease the monitor's real response time thus ghosting is not eliminated at all.", "5) it does has some backlight bleeding and it will only become worse with time: pictures look crap because of backlight bleeding.", "I do not recommend this monitor.

But, the brightness doesn't go too low there is no light around. So, I had to stop using the feature that I especially looked upon. Anyway, it's a value for money product.

I tested running the 1w flash light continuously and it ran way longer than with the kit battery which was 700 mah, but not for 2.5 hrs.", "Now coming to the trimmer part, i was using a panasonic trimmer which had an internal battery which was not same as a AA battery, but a modified slightly longer AA battery. I was planning to replace the trimmer battery with this and i sticked a metal cap to elongate the tip and put it in my trimmer. Then only i noticed that the trimmer is running at a lower speed, which indicated that these batteries have a low current capacity. So if you are buying this for a heavy duty equipment like a trimmer, RC car or anything with a motor, i recommend that you go for a costly battery, may be Sony.", "As a quick help to someone who is confused whether to go with a higher capacity battery, remember that NiCd/MH batteries require atleast 4 or 5 cycles of full charge/discharge an year for a good life. In case you are buying this for a mouse or keyboard or any low power devices i recommend that you go with a lower capacity one like 1000 mah or lesser so that you can discharge it completely atleast once in 3 months.", "And another thing which i would like to mention is not to accept any batteries with mfg date beyond 1.5 years.
